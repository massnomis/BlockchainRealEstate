Talked to leshner today about Interst rates, early days of defi and MakerDao

Very interesting things i noted (I find it intersting, especially because I said them lol)

the way I see compounds differentiation is by competing with the DSR, saying, "this isnt defi" we want positive interest rates. So then the Americans broke away from the european taxes and started their own democracy
and makerdao has taxes, like a stability fee, Americans don't want a part of that.


Just like the traditional financial markets, European powers dominated it (UK, Netherlands), While Defi was also started by Europeans (Adam back (satoshi-UK), MakerDAO-Denmark, Vialatik-Canada/Russia, ethereum - Switzerland(kinda)) but they were acting like a mafia. makerdaos model is to buy down MKR, instead of allowing freedom and two way money markets. then the Americans came along, wanted democracy, INNOVATED (yourself included), had private companies invest, but in a manner that empowered the people. I mean I am here today writing about compound because its democratic, open, and profitable for me on the outside. I am not sure how much of this was deliberate, but history repeats itself. Also like the federal government in the USA, compound labs is kind of powerless, compared to an old European bank or makerdao.
uint constant defaultOriginationFee = 0; // default is zero bps
